JavaScript: The Quiz

Every step in this process will change within the same page by using document.getElementById( ).

Homepage sets all variables and fills in card2 with text. Scoreboard will be blank until a user completes a game.

When the user presses button, page will ask for username. Username will be set and game will start on submit. Timer counts down from 1000 and decreases by 20 every second. There will be 5 questions each with timer increase when correct or decrease when wrong. Each question will deduct 25 counts and correct answer will increase it by 100 + a difficulty factor.

Questions will have 5 answer choices set inside of buttons. Correct answers will display "CORRECT" and incorrect answers will display "NOPE" at bottom of screen. This will last 0.5 seconds before switching to new screen with next question.

If timer reaches 0 or user completes all questions game will end with timer being the user score. Username and score is displayed and a button to continue is clicked to display home page with a screen displaying the score on a scoreboard with the username. Every time the quiz is taken username and score will be added to the scoreboard, displayed in order of highest to lowest scores.

This would be super dope if it actually works...
